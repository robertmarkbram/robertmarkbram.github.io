> Eclipse: content assist or completion? [Mirror of this Blogger post](https://robertmarkbramprogrammer.blogspot.com/2007/06/eclipse-completion-or-completion.html).

<p>Wonderful IDEs like Eclipse offer control+space content assist presenting a drop-down list of tokens that match what you have typed in so far.</p>

<p>Eclipse offers another completion though - word completion. Press control+/ and Eclipse will fill in the token automatically with the first case sensitive match for what you have typed so far.</p>

<p>Press control+/ again... and again... to cycle through all the matches. If you are in a method with a local variable called myLocalVar, type myL, then press control+/ and Eclipse will complete myL for you, making it myLocalVar.</p>
